Simulation of 4 OS algorithms:
- Processors Time Scheduling:
  1.  FCFS (First Come First Serve) - fcfs.py
  2.  SJF non preemptive (Shortest Path Firs in non preemptive version) - sjf(non).py
  
- Memory Page Replacement Algorithms:
  2.  FIFO (First In First Out) - fifo.py
  3.  LRU (Least Recently Used) - lru.py
  
Every .py file works as independent Python script
