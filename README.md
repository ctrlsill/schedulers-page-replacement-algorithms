Simulation of 4 OS algorithms:
Processors Time Scheduling:
1. FCFS (First Come First Serve) - fcfs.py
2. SJF non preemptive (Shortest Path Firs in non preemptive version) - sjf(non).py

Memory Page Replacement Algorithms:
5. FIFO (First In First Out) - fifo.py
6. LRU (Least Recently Used) - lru.py
  
Every .py file works as independent Python script 

This scripts simulate whole process of 

INPUT: number of processes to be generated (default = 5 for demonstration reasons)

Steps of scripts execution:
1. Generator returns given number of processes and loads it to processes[] 
2. Processes are being randomly added in real time to ready queue (ready[]):
    - if there is no processes in queue in current cycle - program goes to next cycle waiting for processes
    - if there are some ready processes - queue is processed by according sorting algorithm and then 1 process from the front of queue is loaded for execution by processor

OUTPUT:
Script prints out to the console the state of every execution cycle:
- [i] - info messages of performed actions in current cycle like: loading of the next process or termination of process
- current queue of ready processes
- number of current cycle
- currently running process PID and time left to end of its execution 
- list of already terminated processes
- * when all of generated processes end its execution, program prints out summary of its execution:
    - total cycles, 
    - average waiting time,
    - logs
